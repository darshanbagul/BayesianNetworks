# Bayesian Learning
This repository contains the implementation of a Bayesian Network for modelling probability distributions of several variables pertaining US Universities obtained from [US News and World Report](https://www.usnews.com/education) for the course CSE 574: Introduction to Machine Learning at SUNY Buffalo.

## Problem Description
the goal of the project is to construct a Bayesian Network correlating various features of the US Universities' data with a joint probability distribution, such that it's log likelihood is better than that of data if the variables are assumed to be independent.

## Implementation

Follow along the Ipython notebook for step by step explanation along with the implementation.
